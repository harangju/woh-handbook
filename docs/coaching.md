# Proof-of-Learning

Coaching is vital to running a scholarship program. In Axie Infinity, you earn more $SLP the higher your MMR. So the better everyone is in a scholarship program, the more everyone earns. We also need coaching for our esports team.

## Proof

Coaches,
- You need to show screenshots for the result each game that you coach.
    - The picture must include the MMR.
- Combine the screenshots into one.
    - You can use [websites](https://www.photocollage.com/) or apps.
- Post the picture on the #gym channel. Tag yourself and the person you coached.

## Scheduling

If you want to coach for the week,

- post a picture of your latest MMR
- say what days and times you can coach

## Watching other people’s coaching

- Scholars are encouraged to watch other people’s coaching.
- You can learn about axies that you don’t have.

## Scheduling

- When a coach posts the coaching schedule, you can let the coach know which time you want to get coaching.

# Examples

To schedule a coaching session, post a screenshot of your MMR and your schedule for that week.

To show proof-of-learning, post a screenshot for each game. The screenshot should **include the MMR**.

# Future Ideas

- Rewarding more when
    - the student’s MMR increases with coaching
    - the coach’s MMR is higher
        - Ex) 1800 MMR=50 SLP, 2000 MMR=65 SLP, 2200 MMR=80 SLP
- Rewarding the managers of the coaches
